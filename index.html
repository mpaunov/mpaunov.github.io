                        Never promise to do the possible.
                        Anyone could do the possible. You should promise to do the impossible,
                        because sometimes the impossible was possible, if you could find the right way,
                        and at least you could often extend the limits of the possible. And if you failed,
                        well, it had been impossible.
                        “Moist groaned. It was the crack of seven and
                        he was allergic to the concept of two seven o'clocks in one day.”THERE WAS ALWAYS an angle.
                        There was always a price. There was always a way.
                        And look at it like this, Moist thought: Certain death had been replaced with uncertain death,
                        and that’s an improvement, isn’t it? He was free to walk around…well, hobble, at the moment. And
                        it was just possible that somewhere in all this was a profit. Well, it could happen. He was good
                        at
                        seeing opportunities where other people saw barren ground. So there was no harm in playing it
                        straight for a few days, yes? It’d give his foot a chance to get better, he could spy out the
                        situation, he
                        could make plans. He might even find out how indestructible golems were. After all, they were
                        made
                        of pottery, weren’t they? Things could get broken, maybe.
                        Moist von Lipwig raised his eyes and examined his future.
                        The Ankh-Morpork Central Post Office had a gaunt frontage. It was a building designed for a
                        purpose. It was, therefore, more or less, a big box to employ people in, with two wings at the
                        rear,
                        which enclosed the big stable yard. Some cheap pillars had been sliced in half and stuck on the
                        outside, some niches had been carved for some miscellaneous stone nymphs, some stone urns had
                        been ranged along the parapet, and thus Architecture had been created.
                        In appreciation of the thought that had gone into this, the good citizens, or more probably
                        their
                        kids, had covered the walls to a height of six feet with graffiti in many exciting colors.
                        In a band all along the top of the frontage, staining the stone in greens and browns, some words
                        had been set in letters of bronze:
                        “‘NEITHER RAIN NOR SNOW NOR GLO M OF NI T CAN STAY THESE MES ENGERS
                        ABO T THEIR DUTY,’” Moist read aloud. “What the hell does that mean?”
                        “The Post Office Was Once A Proud Institution,” said Mr. Pump.
                        “And that stuff?” Moist pointed. On a board much further down the building, in peeling paint,
                        were the less heroic words:
                        DONT ARSK US ABOUT: rocks troll’s with sticks All sorts of dragons Mrs. Cake Huje
                        green things with teeth Any kinds of black dogs with orange eyebrows Rains of spaniel’s.
                        fog.
                        Mrs. Cake
                        “I Said It Was A Proud Institution,” the golem rumbled.
                        “Who’s Mrs. Cake?”
                        “I Regret I Cannot Assist You There, Mr. Lipvig.”
                        “They seem pretty frightened of her.”
                        “So It Appears, Mr. Lipvig.”
                        Moist looked around at this busy junction in this busy city. People weren’t paying any attention
                        to him, although the golem was getting casual glances that didn’t appear very friendly.
                        This was all too strange. He’d been—what, fourteen?—when he’d last used his real name. And
                        heavens knew how long since he’d gone out without some easily removable distinguishing marks. He
                        felt naked. Naked and unnoticed.
                        To the interest of no one whatsoever, he walked up the stained steps and turned the key in the
                        lock. To his surprise, it moved easily, and the paint-spattered doors swung open without a
                        creak.
                        There was a rhythmic, hollow noise behind Moist. Mr. Pump was clapping his hands.
                        “Well Done, Mr. Lipvig. Your First Step In A Career Of Benefit Both To Yourself And The
                        Wellbeing
                        Of The City!”
                        “Yeah, right,” muttered Moist.
                        He stepped into the huge, dark lobby, which was lit only dimly by a big but grimy dome in the
                        ceiling; it could never be more than twilight in here, even at noon. The graffiti artists had
                        been at
                        work here, too.
                        In the gloom he could see a long, broken counter, with doors and pigeonholes behind it.
                        Real pigeonholes. Pigeons were nesting in the pigeonholes. The sour, salty smell of old guano
                        filled the air, and, as marble tiles rang under Moist’s feet, several hundred pigeons took off
                        frantically
                        and spiraled up toward a broken pane in the roof.
                        “Oh shit,” he said.
                        “Bad Language Is Discouraged, Mr. Lipvig,” said Mr. Pump behind him.
                        “Why? It’s written on the walls! Anyway, it was a description, Mr. Pump! Guano! There must be
                        tons of the stuff!” Moist heard his own voice echo back from the distant walls. “When was this
                        place
                        last open?”
                        “Twenty years ago, Postmaster!”
                        Moist looked around.
                        “Who said that?” he said. The voice seemed to have come from everywhere.
                        There was the sound of shuffling and the click-click of a walking stick, and a bent, elderly
                        figure
                        appeared in the gray, dead, dusty air.
                        “Groat, sir,” it wheezed. “Junior Postman Groat, sir. At your service, sir. One word from you,
                        sir, and I will leap, sir, leap into action, sir.” The figure stopped to cough long and hard,
                        making a
                        noise like a wall being hit repeatedly with a bag of rocks. Moist saw that it had a beard of the
                        short,
                        bristled type, which suggested that its owner had been interrupted halfway through eating a
                        hedgehog.
                        “Junior Postman Groat?” he said.
                        “Indeedy, sir. The reason being, no one’s ever bin here long enough to promote me, sir. Should
                        be Senior Postman Groat, sir,” the old man added meaningfully, and once again coughed
                        volcanically.
                        “Ex-postman Groat” sounds more like it, Moist thought. Aloud he said, “And you work here, do
                        you?”
                        “Aye, sir, that we do, sir. It’s just me and the boy now, sir. He’s keen, sir. We keeps the
                        place
                        clean, sir. All according to Regulations.”
                        Moist couldn’t stop staring. Mr. Groat wore a toupee. There may actually be a man somewhere
                        on whom a toupee works, but whoever that man might be, Mr. Groat was not he. It was chestnut
                        brown, the wrong size, the wrong shape, the wrong style, and, all in all, wrong.
                        “Ah, I see you’re admirin’ my hair, sir,” said Groat proudly, as the toupee spun gently. “It’s
                        all
                        mine, you know, not a prunes.”
                        “Er…prunes?” said Moist.
